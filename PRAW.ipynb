I was hyper-aware of my own body/limbs to the point that it hurt. \\n\\nAt the time, a family friend (who is a GP) told me it was probably just nerves, and to leave it at that, but fast forward 10+ years and I'm still going through the same kind of thing--e.g. arm pain leading up to starting university in 2013, and feeling a dull aching in my right leg. Last night it actually woke me up, and I felt this restless aching in both of my legs that was all I could think about when trying to get back to sleep. The more I seemed to focus on it, the more it seemed to hurt, and vice versa in maddening kind of cycle.\\n\\nHas anyone else experienced anything like this? I'm not asking for a diagnosis -- I'll probably muster up the energy to go and see a GP some point soon for a second opinion (I don't suffer from many other symptoms of anxiety other than palpitations and general over-thinking/over-worrying, and on the rare occasion a feeling of falling backwards/being on a roller coaster when lying down) -- but I'm just curious to know how anyone else manages it, or if it's a 'thing' among many others? \",\n",

It just feels like so much I need to fall in line with that makes my anxiety freak out.  Because of my anxiety I struggle sleeping and I lose a lot of the oomph to actually get up and out of my room to do things which of course leads in to a snowball effect of me not being a part of their schedule, getting scolded, becoming more anxious, and repeat.\\n\\nI get so anxious that I can‚Äôt wait to go back to school and be stressed out and anxious over there than be at home.

       "  \"When we experience an unwanted intense emotion, be it anger, depression, anxiety or something else, often our reaction is more intense than it should be because something has ‚Äútriggered‚Äù us. The result is an overreaction or disproportionate reaction. The easy way to know is to imagine if you had an absolutely perfect life, and if this was the first time that something bad happened to you, would you have reacted the same way? \\n\\nWhat is your trigger? Often it's not the situation itself but the feeling it generates, uncertainty, worthlessness, powerlessness etc. The subconscious remembers the pain of those feelings in the past, especially from trauma and especially from childhood trauma. When it gets triggered, the overreaction starts because the subconscious is telling you this is a life or death, fight or flight situation.\\n\\nGet to know your triggers, just being aware of them takes away their most of their power over you.\\n\\nPLEASE READ MY OTHER POSTS\",\n",

A company hired me out of school in a different State but I've never lived outside of my home state or lived by myself. This is my first ever salary job as well. I've had depression and subsequently anxiety since I was 13.\\n\\nI'm an analytical driver who is always trying to go above and beyond but I tend to overthink. I hold myself to a high standard to the point it cripples me from reaching those standards and every day feels like a battle lost. \\n\\nI can't clean, work out, talk to people outside of work, or even play video games. All I've been able to do since graduating is lay in bed and work. \\n\\nProblem:\\n\\nI've recently accepted the fact I have anxiety and am now noticing that many of my (romantic, health, social, work) weaknesses stem from it. \\n\\nAt work I can't bring myself to speak up in meetings. I tend to think slowly and methodically so I'm afraid of stuttering or not being able to effectively answer questions. People at work always ask my why I'm sad or distressed and it's because I'm trying to read and predict everything beforehand so I can have an adequate response. The job is somewhat high intensity and I work long hours so chronically subjecting my body and mind to this high stress I create is killing me. \\n\\nRomantically and socially, it's simple: I have a hard time talking to people because I don't want to bother them. It's even harder because I don't know them and can't anticipate the branches in conversation fast enough. Rationally, it doesn't make sense to expect anything from another stranger and that creates too many scenarios for me to keep track of so I shut down. \\n\\nHealth-wise, I just get so wrapped up in whether I'm doing things right (lifting reps, weights, form) that I psych myself out and give up. I know working out will help with my depression and anxiety but I'm always worried I won't do it efficiently or consistently progress.\\n\\nIt's the same story with playing music. I used to love playing music but whenever I play or try to write, I get so frustrated and worried that it sounds the same or the melody isnt compelling or my harmonies aren't unique. \\n\\nEverything I do turns into a self-made battle with conditions that are impossible to fight by. \\n\\nQuestion:\\n\\nWhat things can I do or say to get myself out of this so I can continue to improve?\",\n",

       "  'I originally posted this in r/ADHD because I have that and I thought people there could tell me if I was just expressing symptoms of ADHD, but I feel like people with actual anxiety could help me loads more on this\\n\\n\\nI would hugely appreciate it if a few people read and responded, I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs so long I just have a lot of thoughts. I don‚Äôt know where to post this at all so I hope that by posting this here I might get some help from some people who think a lot like me. Ok so here‚Äôs some vague background information. I‚Äôm in high school (male) and I haven‚Äôt told anybody that I know that I have ADHD. I have known that I have had it since I was 8 and am medicated. Nobody knows except my parents. I honestly don‚Äôt know if I am ever going to tell anyone ever. I used to have no friends up until about 2 years ago. That is when I met my current friends. Up until then I was really unlikable and got bullied a lot and often. Around that time I started caring what people thought about me and I think that is why people started becoming my friend. Fast forward about a year and I have good friends, but I worry a lot. I kept a journal too and I wrote down that I felt like it was for the better and that it was good to worry because if you didn‚Äôt worry than people wouldn‚Äôt like me. Around that time one of my close friends told me that he genuinely thought I had autism before he met me because I had an IEP for my ADHD (they would take me out of class 5 minutes early and check to see if my work was done). This made me worry even more about how people saw me. Around 2 years ago I also started often putting my hand in my hair and touching my face a lot without realizing it. I also kept digging at my nail beds too when I got nervous. I just thought this was my ADHD. This year has been very different for me. I feel like I totally changed. I am a quiet kid now when I used to be the one who tried to talk the most. I find myself knowing answers but not raising my hand because I don‚Äôt want the attention on me. I don‚Äôt know what to do though. I have a girlfriend and have a bunch of friends, but I always feel like kinda weird. I don‚Äôt think I can describe the feeling fully. I always just feel out of place unless I‚Äôm alone. I also have kind of highs and lows where one day I‚Äôll feel good and confident and the next I‚Äôll be a mess and have lots of self doubt. I still often tough my face and put my hands in my hair and crack my knuckles and shake my leg even though I have tried many many times to stop. I have had this feeling that I have something else  than ADHD. I have trouble talking to people too because I don‚Äôt know what to say. I find myself a lot happier when I am not face to face with people. I can‚Äôt tell what it is though, I read a lot of articles and I think I might have generalized anxiety disorder too but I‚Äôm not sure and I don‚Äôt know how I would tell. I don‚Äôt feel comfortable telling my parents, or telling anyone for that matter. I just don‚Äôt know what to do. If you read this far, thank you and I‚Äôm sorry this was just a huge rant',\n",

I\\'m only taking 3 actual classes along with 2  other music focuses classes, and only 1 of them is AP and another is pre-AP.

I feel like I\\'m always tired, and one night of not getting enough sleep will ruin it for the rest of the week. I can barely bring myself to do these easy things that everyone else does, so how am I supposed to succeed in college or life?\\n\\nI want to play trombone for a living, and hopefully will, but I am worried a little bit because lots of people say that is not a good career choice, or that I won\\'t earn much money, but I don\\'t really care. I feel motivated partially by my grandparents who said they can\\'t wait to see me playing Jazz in New Orleans when I grow up, and by my instructor, who is the nicest and most motivational person to me, who has noticed that I really enjoy music and pushed me harder to be good, and is retiring right before my senior year, which was heartbreaking for me. I was also really inspired by the new Spider-Man movie. It was really uplifting especially the message about how anyone can be behind the mask. Also the soundtrack is amazing and is so motivation. I just want to be working a career where I will actually enjoy, even if it means waking up at 6 and putting in the extra effort, it just feels hard right now, and I know I should keep trying even if the conditions aren\\'t good but I can\\'t all the time.\\n\\nI took a volunteer opportunity to help fundraising for band and earn a little money by bagging at Lund\\'s & Byerly\\'s and it was terrible. It was only two hours, and I caught on pretty quickly, but it felt like it took forever and was so much constant work, and it discouraged me from retail jobs, even though I\\'ve been looking at applying to an AMC that I can walk to easily for a while but now I don\\'t want to anymore. I don\\'t want to get a job now, but everyone else has jobs, and I need to start getting money and habits for college, but it is lots of work. \\n\\nI\\'ve been trying to push myself more musically though, but I\\'m even losing some motivation to practice at times because when I get home I just want to take a nap or something. I love the music, and take lessons from the professor at the U, and will hopefully end up going their and majoring in music. I am in more bands than I can count and have to wake up at 6 am so I can walk to school carrying two heavy trombone in the freezing Minnesota winters for rehearsals because I can\\'t drive (I have my permit, but don\\'t want to get hours with my parents, and am content with walking for now) , and have even more during the day and after school. I never feel worn out from band, especially when it\\'s at school or with a director, but when I have to practice at home it becomes difficult because I have homework for all my other classes and band takes a lot of concentration to play well and practice well, and I just don\\'t have that by when I\\'m done walking home. Even if I take a nap after I get home, then I don\\'t like practicing later because I know my parents will be listening to me, and even though they say they don\\'t mind, it doesn\\'t stop me from not liking it, so I try to find as much time to practice while they are gone. I feel like I\\'m just being lazy because everyone else already does these things like working and driving, on top of sports and tons of hard classes but I can barely manage my few things.\\n\\nOne of the few homework assignments I\\'ve been able to do on time (not the morning of) is read the Great Gatsby. I don\\'t know why but this book intrigued me. I normally hate reading books, especially for school, even though when I was in elementary school I used to love them. I dropped an AP Lit and Composition class because I struggled with reading and such so much, but I\\'m enjoying this book. Were only one chapter in so hopefully it stays interesting, but I don\\'t know why I didn\\'t hate it immediately. The setting I guess seemed interesting, since it was about rich people in New York and in the Jazz Age, but I was able to make it past the first hurdle and like the themes about rich people in the book. I don\\'t know how it will play out, other than that he thinks rich people are shallow, but I liked the idea. I can kind of relate the the main character, Nick Carraway, partially because were both from MN, but also because I have a friend who seems solely driven by money, greed, and popularity. Were very good friends and I enjoy being around him a lot, and hes hilarious, I just think hes shallow. He wants to become a doctor, even though he said he probably wouldn\\'t enjoy it or be good at it because of his shaky hands, but he wants to do it because of the money. He is an insanely hard worker, which I kind of understand and respect, but I think he does it for the wrong reasons. He overworks himself by taking the hardest classes possible, doing everything he can to get scholarships and be the best at everything. He the captain of the ski team, and even plays trumpet too. He thinks even with a 4.0 and all these other things he won\\'t be able to get into any good colleges, and says that I won\\'t be able to do much with my few AP classes, and that a C in an AP classes is better than an A in a regular one. He stays up late doing homework and drives around with friends and girls at night and after school because it\\'s the \"cool\" thing to do. He has a super skewed perception of reality where it seems like he almost things life is like an 80\\'s movie. Loud, fast cars are cool. Drugs are cool. We have to drive around late and do donuts because it\\'s cool. He\\'s always looking for some party and always acts so fake around other people in an effort to be \"cool\". Although he acts like this I\\'m pretty certain I know where it stems from. His dad. His dad watches tons of 80\\'s movies, drives loud cars, listen to 80\\'s rock music, and has even said before that he thinks money is the key to happiness. His dad is a hard ass and he clearly gets these things from him, but I wish he would be more open to other things, different genres of music (he hates rap and jazz, no matter how much I say it isn\\'t that bad). I think with the amount of effort and work he puts into things, he could do amazing in a career he likes, and I want him to be happy, it just doesn\\'t seem like that is going to happen. He wants to go to the U also, so hopefully we\\'ll stay in touch in college.\\n\\nI want to be able to stay on top of things, know when things are and do them on time. I\\'ve tried getting a calendar app for my phone, but that didn\\'t help. I feel like I need a small physical calendar, but I don\\'t want to ask my parents for one, and I don\\'t know what else to use. I want to exercise and eat right. I am not fat by any means, most people would probably assume I\\'m in good shape, but the only exercise I get is walking home. I also eat like garbage. I don\\'t eat breakfast, eat school lunch, have a regular dinner, but I eat a metric fuck ton of unhealthy, sugary snacks that should make any normal person fat in a day. I\\'m worried when I grow older I will keep these habits and become out of shape. And it\\'s not just that I want to stay in shape either, I want to maybe have some muscle or something to me, but I don\\'t want to ask my parents to exercise, or do it when I have to practice, but the only things I can think of to do in my small room is push-ups. Also I have trouble with brushing my teeth consistently, but the dentist says my teeth are fine, but I\\'m still worried they are yellow or not good.\\n\\nSometimes I question whether I\\'m happy or not or even have a mental illness, as I don\\'t want to ask, because I have good days, and thoroughly enjoy talking to people and going to band events, but when I\\'m at home I pretty much always feel completely awful, and I kind of can\\'t wait for college just so I never have to come back to this house again. I\\'m sure my parents will want me to come back for summer breaks and what not but I really won\\'t want to. Because I feel confident on my own and doing things on my own, it\\'s mostly the fact that I am worn out, or am worried that my parents are judging me from doing things well. I can interact with people normally now and even have much more confidence in these things, but I lose it all when my parents are around, because they raised me as a shy little kid, and  I think they partially believe that I still am, so I am afraid to try new things when around them and lose confidence. At school, though, I am very confident now, and it makes me happy sometimes. I dress how I wanna dress, in cool outfits that I like, and talk to people more and know how to talk to people more. In middle school I could barely hold a conversation with anyone without being awkward, but now I can turn awkward situations into funny ones.\\n\\nI don\\'t know why I made this I just feel overwhelmed with thoughts, and needed to share them with another person. Hopefully it isn\\'t all over the place, as I was just writing what was in my head, and what I\\'ve been thinking about. This isn\\'t all of my thoughts but it is a lot of the big ones.',\n",

Had lots of things going on last month (my SO's cousin's 2nd wedding, my SO's farewell work dinner party, Christmas rush, anxious about working during the Christmas period and the commute to work via train, also having a shit for brains manager who couldn't decide when to roster me until the last second).\\n\\nEverything just sort of blew up and I had a massive freak out, to the point where I had to call an ambulance and go to the hospital the next day. Unfortunately I waited there for over 8 hours and still did not see the hospital's psychiatrist. I decided to go home and within a few days in started to get a bit better. There was still a lot of tension, especially during the evening/night I would have to take an anti-emetic **(Maxolon)** as I would get severely nauseous.\\n\\nIt was a bit better throughout the first half of December, but I was still feeling anxious, so I went to a new GP that specialised in mental health. She prescribed me **Zoloft 25mg** for a week, while I was tapering off **Efexor XR** (taking **75mg** for a week). About a few days after the switching, I started feeling severely ill again and blamed it on my acid reflux. But as I continued **Zoloft**, eventually upping the dose to **50mg** (and finally within the last couple of days, she put me on **100mg**, shortly after I returned back to Efexor\\\\*\\\\*)\\\\*\\\\*, I started to feel very sick. I stopped sleeping, would get very nauseous, couldn't even look at food without gagging. All I would eat is dry toast and sometimes I would force myself a piece of fruit when the nausea ceased.\\n\\nI told the GP all of the side effects and that I haven't been eating properly, lost a lot of vitamins, some weight and basically that I couldn't do it anymore. She put me back on **Efexor XR** (took **75mg** the first day going back and now taking my normal **150mg dose**). For insomnia, I tried **Zopiclone 7.5mg**, that did nothing, so I switched to **Temazepam 10mg,** it's a bit better but I am still waking up several times during the night/dawn. It has been 3 days since I switched back to **Efexor**, and I don't remember having any side effects when I first started it back in 2015, so I am unsure whether it is the **Efexor** doing it or because **Zoloft** is still in my system. I have been through a rollercoaster, both physical and emotional.\\n\\nMost mornings these days I am still crying uncontrollably, but eventually it ceases and I have to find a way to relax, to breathe, to keep my mind occupied. Today, my appetite has slightly increased, which is a great sign, but I hope this isn't a fluke. Could I please get some advice on how to cope, how to sleep again? I have tried sleep hygiene, turning off electronics half hour or more before going to sleep, not eating late, trying to relax myself (however I can), but it's still not working.\\n\\nI might also mention that during December I was using an OTC sleep aid called **Restavit (antihistamine)**, which would knock me out. But eventually it stopped working, hence I am now on **benzodiazepines**, I really do not want to get addicted to them, as I have a penchant for overusing medication and getting addicted. But when I cannot sleep, I force myself to take one, any sleep is better than none.\\n\\nApologies for the long post, but I just thought I might reach out and get some help. I have also been diagnosed with clinical depression, OCD, social phobia. I appreciate any advice.\",\n",

I‚Äôve been in combat in the Middle East, I‚Äôve been shot at, and then I started my life over with my wife and kids after a successful time in the military and worked multiple minimum wage jobs to make ends meet. Until I landed a job in what was probably the best company I‚Äôve ever worked for.

I wish I never asked for this and there‚Äôs no way I can ask to undo it... it would be career suicide. My peers are 10-20 years older than me and some thought I was too young and inexperienced. The person I replaced was terrible and left this a mess.\\n\\nI‚Äôve also started considering finding a new job, but my company is awesome and so are my benefits.

       "  \"I have been anxious my whole life even as a kid. I have been off and on of so many anxiety and depression medications. \\n\\nIt has gotten so much worse a year ago in October my mother had a major stroke and lost her memory and vision. It was really bad and I had just went through a painful break up with my exboyfriend of 3 years.\\n\\nI am with a wonderful man now who I've been with for 8 months and it works much better. I still have my issues though.\\n\\nI get pathetically jealous of his friends because I was cheated on by an ex and he used friends as a cover and my previous ex always put his friends before me even when I was sick.\\n\\nI hold myself back from so much. Dancing, friends, school, and work. I am fearful of rejection and embarrassment. I have severe social anxiety. Now I know these are my issues to fix but I feel like shit. I have so much I want to do but so much fear\\n\\nI'm looking for low cost therapy but I just needed to vent I'm sorry.\",\n",
       "  \"Is this weird? It's not that I'm scared of dying, or that my time on earth will just abruptly end so I wouldn't say it's like the typical chronophobia that most websites talk about and try to inform us about. I don't really know how to explain myself very well (English isn't my native language, so that doesn't help much as well), so if there's someone here who can relate and could do a better job at doing so, then please, do go ahead. But nonetheless, I'll still give it a shot. (woooow I just got done writing this and wow, it turned out way longer than I had anticipated lmao, sorry about that...)\\n\\nI'm scared of what feels like routine now, will change as time goes on. I'm scared that what makes me happy right now, will one day cease to make me happy. I'm scared that I'm taking time, and everything in life for granted and I can't seem to shake that feeling.\\n\\nI'll try and give an example. I have a girlfriend and we're very much in love. We're currently in a long distance relationship, but we visit each other at least a week every month and we have plans of moving in together this year. When I visit her, we have tons of fun together, and we do loads of different things. But when I do have to go back home, it feels like I took the time we had together for granted. It's like one second I was having lunch with her at a nice restaurant, laughing and having a chat, and the next second we were at the airport and I was an emotional wreck because I had to leave her. And right there and then, when I'm feeling sad and thinking about the week we spent together, it feels like that week didn't even happen, sort of. It happened. I was happy. But it feels like it ended too quick, like time just flew by. I visited her in December for a whole month, and again, as soon as I had to leave, that whole month we spent together just started feeling like a second, or like a distant memory or a dream (it doesn't help that I usually have very vivid dreams too). Be it 1 week, 1 month or 2 months, in the end, they all feel the same.\\n\\nAs I said, we're very happy with each other and we're very much in love, but what if one day, for whatever reason, we have to go our separate ways? We talk everyday. We still do stuff together pretty much everyday regardless of the distance, such as watching films or playing video games together. The thought of having to look back at all of this stuff that we do on a daily basis, as nothing but a distant memory, genuinely frightens me. I used my relationship with my girlfriend as an example, but it's really about anything in life. It's about having to look at things, and think about things as just a memory, be they as trivial as they may. It's about having to look back at the time that I spend with my family, in the future, time that I take for granted right now, and think about all of this as a distant memory. It's about how right now I'm young, just sat in my room writing this long ass post, and in a second I will be an 80 year old man, sat on a couch, watching TV.\\n\\nI'm 19, and I've always been really self aware of this kind of stuff since I was really young, but lately it's getting worse. It's starting to feel like everything is meaningless, everything happens and everything ends, and in the end, all that is left from your past life experiences, moments that made you happy, are just memories. Maybe this is normal, maybe most people know what I mean but they just cope with it and go on with their lives, but I can't, and I'm not sure how I should deal with it.. This sub probably isn't meant to be used as therapy session or something, and maybe I should go see a therapist, but right now it's 3 AM, my girlfriend is sleeping, I'm sad and I just wanted to write down how I feel somewhere.\",\n",

I‚Äôve been having a rough couple of weeks, so I figured I‚Äôd vent a bit and welcome any advice.  \\n\\nSo, I‚Äôve been suffering from general panic/anxiety disorder for about 10 years now. Most of that time I was pretty darn good, Been on Prozac and klonopin just about the whole time. The Prozac dosage has gone up from 15>20>25>30 over the last two years. I had an incident a couple years ago where I was out by myself in my car, and had a really bad panic attack. That set me back big time, and I‚Äôm still recovering from it. After that attack I was afraid of my car, afraid of being out, afraid of not being home. The further I go from home, the worse I get. I reinforced these phobias by avoiding situations entirely for at least a year, and now I‚Äôve been trying to fix it for about another year. \\n\\nAfter seeing a psychologist, reading some books, practicing meditation, and getting a headspace subscription, I started getting back out. Of course I had many failures, asking my exposure companion to race me back home, missing out on trips, seeing friends, etc. But from around October to December, I was doing my best. Going to local stores by myself, going to the mall with my girlfriend, to places I haven‚Äôt been..  all pretty local, but things I haven‚Äôt done in years. \\n\\nAround Christmas I got the flu, and my Prozac (fluoxetine) refill was a different generic manufacturer. It didn‚Äôt work. I went through bad withdrawals, getting panic attacks and bad depression. I‚Äôm now on fluoxetine tablets that I used to take years ago, and I‚Äôm struggling. I‚Äôve lost confidence in myself. Not sleeping well, not looking forward to getting out of bed. None of my projects are getting done. I feel pretty awful when I finally get up, and usually end up feeling okay around midnight. \\n\\nI can‚Äôt start every day like this. Plus, it‚Äôs winter and I live in the northeast, and I‚Äôm barely seeing any daylight. I spend most of the year  outside, working on my cars, my garden, projects, etc and now it‚Äôs cold and I can‚Äôt. Everything is making me nervous. I woke up today after sleeping 12 hours, and felt shaky. I knew I had to eat, but I was nervous about going down to the kitchen and actually making food. It‚Äôs like this for nearly everything. I think I‚Äôm staying in my head too much, as I‚Äôve been finding it difficult to meditate while feeling like this. \\n\\nI‚Äôm not sure what to do. Maybe I need to give it a week or two to adjust to the new generic? I‚Äôm leaning on the klonopin more than I used to. Having a very hard time sleeping and getting my schedule in sync with the sun. I don‚Äôt trust myself enough to try going out with all this lightheaded and shakyness I‚Äôve been getting.

       "  'I‚Äôm sry that my original post is really long so here‚Äôs it shortened. I‚Äôm a senior in high school, I‚Äôve performed in both band and choir for all of my years in high school. I was in band from 9th-10th and choir from 11th-12th. Almost every single performance for both I‚Äôve thrown up right before and then went on to perform and that would be on my mind the entire performance and fighting the urge to not throw up. In the second year of both of those activities I‚Äôd feel nauseous in class time and rehearsals and not just performances. When it came to the one solo I‚Äôve ever done, my breathing was out of control, my legs were shaking, my voice was quiet, my lips were quivering, but I wasn‚Äôt nauseous at all. My mind always wants to think of the worst scenario (throwing up in frontof people). People, not an audience specifically.\\n\\nThroughout life I‚Äôve always been really good friends with people, and I‚Äôve always made friends, but I always make sure to not get too close to people to the point where they want to hangout outside of school all the time, but close enough to where I can always hang out with them if I want. It‚Äôs only after when I get home when I notice these things about myself. Recently, I‚Äôve been feeling really nauseous hanging out with my friends, nauseous enough to run to the bathroom if I need to. It‚Äôs probably bc we‚Äôre eating out together, but it happens almost every time, and even long after we‚Äôve eaten I‚Äôd still feel a little nauseous. Talking about it with people makes me feel nauseous and typing this out i feel my throat closing, but not enough to where I‚Äôm going to throw up.\\n\\nI‚Äôm always shy to people if I know I‚Äôm going to be around them a lot (class, performing, barber, counselor/teacher, etc.), but not as shy to people who I probably won‚Äôt ever see again. I‚Äôm always scared of what people will think of me, even my friends. I‚Äôm always trying to make sure I don‚Äôt offend anyone, so I always get other people‚Äôs opinions before I have my own. That‚Äôs why I am easily influenced and don‚Äôt really think for myself, bc I always follow everyone else.\\n\\nI feel like it‚Äôs honestly gotten worse over time. It‚Äôs become a daily issue, it makes me nauseous, it makes me depressed, it makes me feel like I work so hard for no reason. I just want to know if it‚Äôs as bad as I think.\\n\\nSo this post isn‚Äôt really shorter than the last I‚Äôm sry, I just feel like everything I mentioned needs to be a part of this and shouldn‚Äôt be left out so you guys can really tell me if this is an actual problem or am I just worried about nothing.',\n",

Everything I love is contingent upon other people existing I.E. Literature, Film, Psychology. \\n\\nUnlike many other solipsists, I do not hold this opinion by choice and really want to not believe it :(\\n\\nI have done tons of research on the topic and understand that it is an unfalsifiable claim.

I\\'ve dealt with mild social anxiety my whole life but since starting my post-graduate studies I started suffering from general anxiety and mild depression. I started seeing a therapist after having my first ever panic attack. For 2.5 years I attended therapy and used CBT and meditation. It got the panic attacks and the depression under control. That was great but I couldn\\'t shake the general feeling of anxiety (imposter syndrome in academia is a beast).  So my therapist started me on sertraline. I\\'m just starting so I don\\'t know how Ill respond yet, but I\\'m hopeful. \\n\\nMy problem however is that throughout all of my treatment my wife has constantly doubted my anxiety. She asks questions like \"why cant you just be happy?\" And \"I guess our marriage isn\\'t enough to make you content\". I\\'m at the point that I\\'m more worried about her reaction to my anxiety than anything else. Everytime I feel like I take a step forward she knocks me back. She\\'s threatened to leave me during one of my panic attacks.  She\\'s always saying she wants the old version of me back, like the version she dated before I had anxiety. Today she told me that she thinks it\\'s all her fault that I have this anxiety and that she isn\\'t good enough to fix it. I\\'m at a loss at what to tell her or what to do. I want to save the relationship and Im considering trying to start lying about the anxiety getting better to save it. Has anyone else dealt with a spouse or similar relationship problems during treatment? Any strategies or suggestions? ',\n",

       "  \"Hi all, \\n\\nI am currently in my junior year, and in my second semester of living in a dorm. I have pretty bad anxiety and Tourettes syndrome so it is hard for me at times. My family just bought a house and I experienced a case of harassment due to my Tourettes the first weekend back in my dorms, so my anxiety is really working itself up in the past week. I live in the basement level of my dorm and the windows are not sealed super well, so with the extreme wind chill over the past few days I've taken to draping my self with a small throw blanket I bought from home. \\n\\n2 days ago I realized that it smelled strongly of my cat, when I held it against my nose and inhaled. It makes sense since while had it at home with me over winter break, he loved to knead and nap on it whenever he could. I have been really lonely lately and it was sorta driving me a little stir crazy, but discovering the blanket smell has really helped me cope. I don't think I've talked to anyone other professors, and a few words to classmates, or my mother on the phone, in the past week. I miss my cat, and my old house. I have the blanket on right now, and it comforts me in more ways I would have thought possible. It's kinda funny though, I get it now, why my cat loves things that smell like me, I've basically become a cat!\",\n",

I do have PVC's which are basically early heartbeats and ToF which is a leaky heart valve, so this is exacerbating my panic. \\n\\nI fear I am dying and I'm worried for my other dog, who is lonely without his buddy. I don't know what to do or who to talk to. I  feel like my heart is going to explode and I asked askdoctors about it but got no response. \\n\\nHas anybody else been in this situation?

Wasn\\'t sure if I should mark this as \"Need a Hug\" or \"Venting\", cause it\\'s kinda both? \\n\\nI have mild anxiety. For most of my life I\\'ve been pretty good at managing it, and have never taken medication for it. Last year I moved 6hrs away from my childhood home to a new city, and have been supporting myself through university. For the most part its been great and I\\'m happy out here being independent, but my body has gone through a lot of changes and my self esteem and anxiety have gotten worse. \\n\\nI used to be athletic, had good skin, always very healthy. Since moving out I\\'ve stopped being as active (no time to work out due to school), developed nodular acne all over my cheeks and can\\'t even wear makeup to hide it, I\\'ve probably gained over 7 pounds,  and discovered I need significant dental work.  \\n\\nI was sitting on my bathroom floor today, nearly on the edge of a panic attack thinking about everything wrong with me. I\\'m working while taking a 5 course semester. I make barely enough money for rent and groceries, and already used up my student health insurance on getting my wisdom teeth out last April; how am I going to pay for my dental work? The state of my skin makes me miserable, but I can\\'t bring myself to go see the school doctor. Every time I go to call them I get so anxious, I feel like I\\'m physically being held down. \\n\\nI\\'m a fine arts student, and I have I 22\"x30\" self portrait due in 3 days, but I can\\'t bring myself to start it. When I look in the mirror I see pimple cheeks and stomach pudge. Staring at that for the 6+ hours required for a good drawing, might as well be torture. \\n\\nI got myself off the floor, put on The Office to distract myself, and had a bath. Maybe my anxiety is no longer mild. Maybe I should see someone, if I\\'m able to pick up the phone. \\n\\nThanks for reading through this sad stream of consciousness.

       "  \"I have multiple panic attacks a day. I have an acute dread for this world. It is so cold and brutal and indifferent to our welfare. I sometimes fantasize about either taking my life or voluntarily admitting myself to a psychiatric facility where I can become a brain-dead vegetable without concern. It's so hard having a keen and analytical mind. One perpetually constructs hypothetical scenarios in which one is the recipient of terror and brutality. I feel unsafe wherever I am. I dread home invasion. I dread being arrested (even though I haven't committed a crime). \\n\\nWomen receive a lot of sympathy for their anxiety, and they should, because it's terrifying being a woman alone in the world. But young men should receive sympathy too. I don't have a support network of friends and associates to lean on. I'm expected to maintain a stoic reserve, even when I'm hysterical with fear inside. I want to be taken care of. I am utterly alone in this world. The prospect of finding a girlfriend is problematic because I won't be emotionally strong enough to take care of her needs. My male friends are moderately sympathetic to my difficulties, but they don't offer the intimate guidance I need. \\n\\nPills are tempting. I know I can obtain a legal prescription for anti-anxiety medication, but I'm worried they'll dull my creativity and drive. \\n\\nI just want someone to take care of me and assure me of my safety. But nobody on Earth can fulfill that role. The archetypal mother figure who shelters you from the world doesn't exist. She is a myth dreamed by the desperate. All of mythology depicts her as the ultimate refuge from mortal torment, but she's a figment of the frightened male mind. She's the fantasy that men beg for as they bleed to death in combat or bottle immensities of pain in silence. She might well symbolize the final safety of death. \",\n",

       "  \"If you had a friend who came to you devastated by emotional pain, crying and sobbing, what would you do? A good friend would just give them a hug until they stopped sobbing, they would sit with them with their arm around them till they stopped crying, they would just sit and listen to everything their friend has to say until their friends pain felt a little better. \\n\\nHow would you feel if you were the person devastated by emotional pain, you went to your friend for support‚Ä¶ your friend invites you in, but then puts his ear muffs on, turns up the music on the stereo so he can't hear you, then smiled and gives you a thumbs up. The reality is, is that that is exactly what we do to ourselves.\\n\\nWhen we feel intense emotional pain, worthlessness or unlovableness, and maybe it's one of those feelings we can't escape, what do we do? Often we sit there HATING the feeling, maybe HATING ourselves for feeling that way, then we do whatever we can to distract ourselves and avoid feeling the pain. This is nothing more than self hate and self abandonment.\\n\\nWhat we're NOT talking about here is wallowing in self pity‚Ä¶ rather it's kind of like detaching yourself from your pain and just making yourself available to be present and unconditionally allowing of the pain you feel, like the supportive friend. We need to give ourselves permission to feel the pain we feel, we need to tell ourselves it's ok to feel what we feel. Without giving in to self pity, allow yourself to sink deeply into your pain‚Ä¶ feel the fullness of it‚Ä¶ if you need to cry, cry‚Ä¶ if you need to sob, sob‚Ä¶ be completely and unconditionally present for yourself to feel whatever you feel, this is healthy and self loving and self nurturing. Allowing yourself to be unconditionally present with your feelings to the point of crying and sobbing without self pity is part of the grieving and healing process. \\n\\nSo there are 3 ways to feel pain:\\n\\n1: you feel the pain and try to ignore, suppress or distract yourself from it.\\n\\n2: you feel the pain and wallow in self pity hating yourself for it.\\n\\n3: you unconditionally allow yourself to be fully present for your pain without self pity, giving yourself permission to feel whatever you're feeling in a self loving and self caring atmosphere completely free of self hate, self judgement, self criticism, for as long as it takes to feel better, crying if you need to cry, sobbing if you need to sob, it's ok to do so.\",\n",

As the title states I\\'m looking for an outsiders perspective on whether to see my therapist again. \\n\\nSituation: Last week at the end of my session we started talking about social skills training and eye contact was the first thing that we discussed on this. That session essentially ended with me telling him that I personally don\\'t necessarily care for eye contact when having conversations with people. He spent the last 5-10 minutes trying to tell me why he thought it was important for us to discuss it. Fast forward to today\\'s session, within the first 5 minutes I tell him that I feel like my life is going uphill and I don\\'t want to discuss the social skills training any farther. He kept trying to take the conversation back to social skills training. about twenty minutes in we got on the topic of body language. He asked if there was a way I thought body language could help convey a message during a conversation. I responded, \"if we keep talking about skills training, getting up and walking out the door\". queue another 10 minutes of me trying to change the subject. Halfway through the session he finally switches off the skills training and we find new topics that aren\\'t related to skills training to talk about.

Just the thought of making relationships, learning so much, having so many experiences, and then growing old and losing my ability to do so many of these things, losing my friends, and then dying is eating away at me.\\n\\nOver the past week or so, it has gone from a passing anxiety to a crippling pain. \\n\\nAnd time is speeding up, too. I always hear people say it, that life is short, it\\'s gone in the blink of an eye, that they can\\'t believe they\\'re 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, whatever. I feel like I\\'m in a speeding car that\\'s rapidly accelerating and I\\'m desperately trying to slam the brakes but nothing is working. I saw a post the other day where someone said that because of the way our perception of time speeds up as we get older, that the \"true\" halfway point of an average person\\'s life is 24. I\\'m 23, so this is horrifying. I\\'ve seriously been having panic attacks multiple times a day just thinking about this.\\n\\nAnd when I\\'m not having panic attacks, I have a horrible sense of dread and depression overcome me. This feeling like I\\'m almost out of time, like nothing I do matters because I\\'m going to die soon. I feel like I can\\'t do anything I enjoy because I don\\'t see why it matters. Same with studying, doing well at work, eating healthy, working out, etc. I just don\\'t see how it matters because in 100 years I\\'m going to be dead and none of it will have mattered. \\n\\nI\\'ve always been underweight, and over the past 2 months I was making great progress with eating more and working out multiple times a week, since this crippling anxiety started a week ago, I haven\\'t had the motivation because, like I said, I can\\'t convince myself that it even matters.\\n\\nI\\'ve starting obsessively paying attention to the passage of time and my perception of how long it\\'s been since something happened. When I remember something that I feel like just happened, a song coming out, going somewhere, etc., and then I realize that it had happened as long ago as it did, I start panicking again because that\\'s just proof to me that my perception of time is rapidly accelerating and before I know it I\\'ll be bedridden, dying.\\n\\nI just can\\'t find any joy or reason to care because of this. Anytime I feel happy about something I stop myself because I feel like it doesn\\'t matter, and that I\\'m going to be dead soon.\\n\\nI\\'ve heard people say that because of this, I need to do as much, live as much, and enjoy as much of life as I possibly can.

       "  'I‚Äôve been having anxiety and negative obsessive thoughts over a particular person and issue for the past 6 months. I‚Äôm trying to practice mindfulness regularly and going to start therapy next week hopefully. A lot of my worry, negative thoughts, and anxiety stems from thinking way too much about the well being and drug use of my younger brother. He‚Äôs 22, and it‚Äôs not a raging addiction or an addiction at all that I can fully tell. He lives with my mom and dad still and they‚Äôre not worried like I am, neither are my brothers.  I always voice concern to my mom mostly, and she‚Äôs great about listening to me and assuring me not to worry.  She always assures me that she would know if he had a problem, and her and my Dad would never bury their head in the sand if they did think his actions were a problem or getting out of control. They tell me his personality, appearance, and habits haven‚Äôt changed in the 2 years since he first admitted to using some of these drugs, and I agree he‚Äôs still the same kid. He‚Äôs still pleasant and helpful to my parents, he‚Äôs very present in our family and not withdrawn, hangs out and is never secretive or afraid to talk to my mom about his problems from what she says. I‚Äôve never seen him completely blasted or out of it on drugs. He doesn‚Äôt seem like a typical drug addict or display the behaviors you would expect to see of someone with addictions issues, i.e. disappearing for days, sleeping or being up for days. No crazy mood swings, irritability, or erratic behaviors. In all respects and appearances he just seems like a kid that likes to go out and party on the weekends sometimes, like hundreds or thousands of other 20somethings right? No reason to assume he‚Äôs a raging drug addict. The worst thing I can see is that he‚Äôs a little lazy and unmotivated in his goals, but so was I. I didn‚Äôt get into my career until my mid 30‚Äôs, I‚Äôm 41 now. \\n\\nAlso I‚Äôm no angel, I did a lot of drinking and weed smoking, and dabbled in acid and shrooms in my 20‚Äôs, so did my middle brother, and my step brother and we all turned out fine. I never did the hard stuff that he does though, and this is where most my worry comes from, the unknowns of it. . I think he‚Äôs doing stuff like coke, ket, mdma at clubs and festivals, he‚Äôs way into the EDM/rave scene, but who isn‚Äôt these days. Truth is I‚Äôm not even sure how much or how often he does it, all I have are my assumptions and toxic negative thoughts about it. All I have heard are the horror stories you read about and see on TV too. No personal exp to go on like with weed, booze, and psychedelics. I know tons of people recreationally use this stuff and have no problem quitting it and moving on in the future when they‚Äôve had enough too, not everyone turns into a addict.  He has a good head on his shoulder and our family unit and support system is strong. So I like to think if it ever did become a big problem he wouldn‚Äôt be afraid to come to my mom for help, or my middle brother, or step brother. Probably not me though, lol. I‚Äôve already made too big of an issue of his use the last year or so to him and my family, and it‚Äôs to the point that he somewhat dreads seeing me and vice versa, we can‚Äôt relax around each other. I really don‚Äôt want it to be like this, but I just can‚Äôt let the horrible thoughts I get in my head go and move past it. \\n\\nI don‚Äôt see him that often, only a couple times a month, and I‚Äôm always being judgmental of him and questioning him to the point where he doesn‚Äôt even like being around me. An incident last Saturday happened where I saw some druggy social media post he retweeted got to me, and I called my mom to tell her and he overheard and ended up calling me and blowing up at me for making a big deal out of nothing. We both ended up crying, him over my lack of trust in him and thinking I think he‚Äôs some low life drug addict, and me cause he can‚Äôt see I don‚Äôt think that of him and not seeing that all this comes from pure love and concern over him. Nothing got resolved, and as you can see it‚Äôs really effecting our relationship. The stupid thing is I then start thinking, well if he doesn‚Äôt have a problem why does he get so mad and not want to talk to me about it, lol. But the reality is he‚Äôs sick of me bringing it up, and he‚Äôs told me till he‚Äôs blue in the face multiple times that he‚Äôs fine, but it just comes down to me not being able to fully take his word for it and have faith in him. Am I more in the wrong in this situation? \\n\\nI like to think I‚Äôm imagining it to be a bigger deal than it really is, but it‚Äôs hard to control the insidious thoughts of him having a bigger problem than he lets on or shows, and letting my mind get carried away with what could be happening now, and what may happen to him in the future. I‚Äôm always going to be concerned and I don‚Äôt want to ignore his use, but how much I think and worry about it daily has been a problem the last almost 6 months. It‚Äôs not debilitating or anything, but it is getting ridiculous that I think and worry more about his well being than my own some days, and I need to get a handle on this before permanent damage happens in our relationship. \\n\\nAny words of advice or encouragement? Personal experiences, or anecdotes? Could really use some, and not just looking for all sunshine and rainbows either. I can take criticism if you have it. Lol',\n",

I‚Äôm not a perfect 4.0 student, but I shoot for mostly A‚Äôs and a few B‚Äôs if I know I‚Äôm struggling. I generally get those grades, doing well on everything from homework to essays. However, there is one major flaw. I have HORRIBLE test anxiety. I am currently in my second semester of college. I had a strong GPA (3.81) after my first semester. My second semester my classes aren‚Äôt fun and they‚Äôre mostly hard. Not due to the lack of material knowledge, but most of the grading in several of those classes are based on exams. This is a problem because my test anxiety leads me to do things I normally wouldn‚Äôt do. I had an exam today, and I got caught cheating. NOW BEFORE YOU START SAYING HOW BAD I WAS FOR DOING THIS, LET ME EXPLAIN. I‚Äôve already come to accept the consequences for doing what I did and talked to my professor already, who was surprisingly understanding and didn‚Äôt take too much off me as a freshman. She also said she would consider doing something good about it if my grades on later assignments are very solid. It didn‚Äôt go into my transcript and I didn‚Äôt fail the class, but i can‚Äôt get an A in that class anymore unless my assignments are near perfect. Now for the homework that isn‚Äôt a big issue, but there‚Äôs 2 more exams in that class. I can know an entire semester‚Äôs worth of material but once an exam starts I don‚Äôt remember anything, no matter how long I study. This leads to panic and taking action without a second thought, which is what happened now. I talked with my parents about this all day, and I burst into tears at her office, saying I‚Äôll never do it again, as I‚Äôve never cheated in a test in my life and did it that one time as an act of desperation, something I‚Äôll never do again for as long as I live.\\nBut there are a few more things. I know that grades post-college don‚Äôt matter much (especially as a game design major where it‚Äôs all about portfolio building and stuff). So why do I care about grades so much KNOWING they won‚Äôt matter at the end? The test anxiety practically makes or breaks my entire semester, as they‚Äôre a big part of college, and unless I walk out 100% confident I did well, I sucked.\\nI‚Äôm not asking for material knowledge or crap like ‚ÄúWHAT WERE YOU THINKING FOR CHEATING ON THAT EXAM‚Äù because I freaking know I fucked up. I just need whatever help I can get, because I‚Äôm desperate and don‚Äôt feel like I can get over this, despite literally everyone saying it gets better even though I doubt it actually will. I nearly quit college over being caught cheating because I thought that I was getting kicked out of the class with an F.

       "  \"Truth is I'm fucking exhausted and overwhelmed. I do not know how other people get through life, especially during winter. Well yeah, there's coffee and I do like coffee. Problem is coffee can make me really anxious, sweat a lot, have insomnia and trigger a hypomanic episode. It's like do I take the coffee and risk a panic attack/psychosis or let the fiery cold and bitterness of winter bring me down into a depressed and lethargic state. On top of that, I'm freaking out over not getting my period for about two months now. I legit believe I might have PCOS and having an eating disorder that is triggered by exhaustion, anxiety and insomnia is not helping the situation. I wish I could just be normal.\\n\\nI just want to graduate already. I'm tired of being a failure and pathetic. The pressures of the university are heavily underestimated. There are a lot of ridiculously inconsiderate instructors at my school who do not have a clue how they got it easier when they went to school. I mean why do you need to make students submit an essay every damn week and also do the gazillion things you require of them while expecting a superb quality of work that you a supposed teacher with the bringer of knowledge could never produce in your own lifetime never mind that students also have to mind four other courses with mostly the same bullshit. Academy was originally not designed to be a fountain of stress and idiotic competition but the place for enlightenment. Now, it's just all about following useless instructions from useless instructors who are too stuck up in their tiny privileged bubble. I swear this one professor snags a lot of her content from Ted talks and youtube, rambles in class about her **libertarian** ideology, but still makes sure to mention how she hates that there is no **union** for lecturers at my school?? I mean talk about an entitled trainwreck of a person and these are the kind of people adding to the toxicity of our current system.  Personally, I get so anxious when I think of the amount of school work and kissing up to insecure lecturers (in addition to the multitudes of life problems I have to deal with every day) crushing me and I have a  breakdown. This prevents me from doing the assignments and showing up for class.\\n\\nI swear it's one thing or the other. If I start drinking lots of coffee my stomach starts to act up and I get hella nauseous in my head and stomach. I've thrown up twice now this month. I'm so afraid and ashamed of not being able to catch up that I avoid my professors and when I screw up, miss job interviews etc. I'm really tired of the hand I've been dealt with. I mean I know I should be grateful as there are people worse off, but I feel like this is part of the problem. Just because I'm not in a mental asylum or in prison or in a wheelchair or bedridden does not mean that I'm clear to efficiently withstand the stresses of university especially dealing with a toxic cocktail of health issues such as bipolar, anxiety, OCD, SAD, ADHD and now PCOS.\\n\\nTbh, I am truly fucked. I am not fucked enough to receive society's sympathy, but I'm also not normal enough to function as well as (and steadily) like people who do not have any mental health issues. I'm tired really. Tired of pretending and using my last strength to measure up in a game that's rigged in favour of people who won the genetic lottery. Everything is stacked against me right now. Well, virtually everything (I'm not homeless so I've got that going for me). Sometimes I think about what my life would be if could hit a reset button. But no such thing as a reset button in life right? Shit follows you for the rest of your miserable life. I really do not know what to do. I am tired of being a failure in a system that's designed for me to fail.\",\n",

This is also a perscription that I haven't been talking for a few months due to family backlash. \\n\\nLast week I was driving and randomly my head felt very foggy. So much so that I completely took my foot off the gas and seriously considered pulling over. I rolled down my window and took deep breaths and was fine. I thought I might've just had my heat on too high for too long.\\n\\nFast forward to today where I'm driving ~80 miles to visit family and experience this multiple times on the road. I don't know how to describe it, but my chest felt pressure and my head just felt as if I wasn't fully aware. I made sure to keep my heat off in case this was the issue. Obviously I started freaking out when this happened because not being aware while driving is dangerous.\\n\\nDoes anyone else experience this foggy feeling as a result of their anxiety? I'm going to get it checked out regardless, and definitely seek new medication if a provider deems it necessary.\\n\\nTL;DR: I've been having spells of fogginess while driving.

I'm 27 y/o. I'm a girl.\\n\\nI foster cats. I am not paid to do this. I put lots of time into rehabilitation and took difficult cases and found them nice families to go in. I find alot of pride in doing this and every adoption is a pat in my back saying ' you did great! good job ! ' I also love to see the happiness in the adopter's face when they come  to adopt a cat from me. So, it's easy to understand why I'm so passionate about it.\\n\\nI live in a small apartment. I care about my neighbors. I'm a people pleaser. Always want to be nice to everybody and not bother anyone.\\n\\nI took in an adult cat that my local rescue organization found outside. When he was in my apartment the first night , he kept meowing all night. Loud meows. It woke me up and I instantly got a panic attack because I was so stressed that neighbors would knock at my door and complaint. The cat was scratching the walls . I got sick from being so stressed and no matter how hard i tried, the cat would keep meowing and  jump in the window , trying to get out. ( it was a stray cat, not used to indoor life ). I was up all night and had work in the morning. It also woke my boyfriend up, (who was not very happy either) but he knew it wasn't my fault. Because of my medication and my ptsd,  I cannot wake up in fear during the night , otherwise it's a mess of emotions the next day and im unable to function properly. \\n\\nSo i contacted my local rescue and told them about the situation. I told them that for health reasons, I needed to give back the cat to them. One of the three people that runs the shelter was crazy mad about the fact that I wanted to give the cat back because I couldn't let that affect my professional life at work and my mental health. I really liked that person so her being harsh like that with me affected me deeply. I saved countless cats in the past for them and I felt like all I did for them before didn't matter anymore. I cried alot because I'm also learning to stop trying to please everyone and stand my ground when something bothers me ( Also, i was polite in my way of talking to them so I felt it was just unfair ) .\\n\\nI don't know what to do. I kinda feel betrayed, but I don't feel bad for choosing my mental health and making it my priority. I love being able to foster cats but I'm scared that everytime something bad will happen , I will receive the same treatment. What should I do? find a new shelter ? Talk with the person? \\n\\nThanks for reading my story \",\n",

Old job didn't require any on-call time, and the site I worked at was the only one I had to go to (with one rare exception), and it was only about a 30m commute.\\n\\nI've had a knot in my stomach for a good portion of the day so far.

I feel like I have less time to myself than I ever did before, even though I have a pretty similar schedule. I really am just waking up about half an hour earlier, and while the shifts are longer, they're really only longer by about half an hour... but that's still a collective hour I'm now missing out of my day, and then there's the 4am days, where my night goes from in-bed at like 10 or 11, to 9pm. So the 4am days coupled with overtime coupled with on-call time, and... I feel like I just won't have any time left for myself.\\n\\nOn normal days, I still feel like I have no time to myself, even though I know that I do, I feel like I'm letting family down, because they almost certainly helped me to get the job, and... I also know that this is an opportunity that, realistically, I won't be able to beat. I likely need to get professional help and medication, but because it's a new job, asking for time off to see a doctor, let alone *when* I can even see a doctor since so many of them make appointments so far out, makes it even harder to get the proper meds to deal with it all - if that's even what I should do.\\n\\nI feel trapped, and the only thing I can think to do is go back to my old job, where I was happier, and then see some sort of professional on how to better manage my symptoms, along with trying to find something a bit more modestly paying in the next year or two, maybe more, if I can even find a place willing to hire me, and the job itself not being more of the same.\",\n",
       "  \"I want to share a small success I had today. Hopefully it helps someone in a similar situation with their confidence!\\n\\nSo I've been out in the working world for about four years now since earning my undergraduate degree. I was a good student, but pretty quiet and never really got too involved with my department outside of class. I recently made the decision to apply for a masters program at a high-ish ranking university. Part of this process is getting letters of recommendation - something I always have a little trouble asking people for. I had no problem asking my current manager to recommend me, but typically these schools want at least one recommendation from a professor or someone who can attest to your academic performance in your undergraduate studies. The person I had in mind was my professor and mentor for a research project I did during my senior year. I had one of the highest grades in her class and my project was received very well at the time, but it was *four years* ago. Professors could barely remember my name when I was attending their classes, what were the odds she would remember me? Even if she did remember me, would she be able remember enough about me to write a recommendation?\\n\\nI spent almost 2 weeks drafting an email to send to her. First it was too long, then it was too short, then it was too personal, then too formal. Even when I finally had the draft complete, I hovered over the send button and put off sending it to the next day. Well today was that day and I finally sent it, albeit with a little bit of hovering again. I received a reply after a few hours.\\n\\nShe wrote that she definitely remembered me and my project and would love to write a recommendation for me. She also said that she was excited for me to be pursuing graduate school.\\n\\nThe first thought that I had after reading that was: *I can't believe I spent two weeks worrying about this.* Hindsight is 20/20, but to be honest I can't remember a single thing I've wasted energy worrying about where I haven't immediately thought about how irrational those fears were after doing it. Every small victory like this reminds me of how far I've come from where I used to be. I was anxious about doing this and it probably took me way longer to get around to doing it than it should have because of that anxiety, but **I did it**. I'm always going to be anxious, but I'm not letting it stop me from doing what I need to do.\\n\\nTL;DR: Asked prof from 4 years ago for recommendation, got it.\\n\\n&#x200B;\",\n",

       "  'This is my first time posting here, and it seems like a safe place to just kinda talk about what I went through the past few weeks and today. It‚Äôs a gonna be a long post but I just feel like I have to post it.\\n\\nI only started a month ago and I was so excited. It was a rare opportunity that felt like the perfect fit for me. On the surface it seemed like a good place to work. Pay was good, benefits were great, and the work didn‚Äôt seem beyond my skills. It was a far drive but I figured it was worth it for the opportunity.\\n\\nI left a job I loved for this new gig to expand my resume and further develop my career. I liked my last job so much because it allowed me to break through my anxiety by giving me a chance build confidence in my role via the support of a great boss. It made me extremely sad to leave, but this new place seemed great for me.\\n\\nThat was until I got about a week in. \\n\\nI noticed things didn‚Äôt seem right. For example, there was no manager for my department. Instead the company director was my supervisor, however since they were busy all the time, me and the only other person in my department were instead being managed by another co-worker from a different department. \\n\\nThey knew fuck all about what we did so that meant all my questions about the job had to be directed to the only other co-worker in the department. \\n\\nThis person was insufferable and would poorly communicate directions to me. Every time I tried to act on what they taught me I was told to do it differently or that I did it wrong. She would then take over whatever I was doing and just told me to watch. She would repeat directions for the simplest tasks over and over again like I was a child. This ultimately led my anxious thoughts to increase day by day task by task. I couldn‚Äôt work without worrying that I was doing it wrong. This is a normal feeling for me, but I was feeling it for things that I did on a daily basis at my old job. It was like I was retroactively feeling the anxiety that I avoided in my old job.\\n\\nIt was clear this person has never trained anyone in her life. And I should note that this job was essentially the same job I had before but just scaled up a bit. There were a lot of things I didn‚Äôt need to be trained on because I was hired under the pretense that I already had that experience.\\n\\nThis led to a complete loss of confidence in the position. As someone who has suffered with anxiety my entire life, I find confidence to be an incredibly valuable commodity. So to lose it is a big deal.\\n\\nI brought my concerns up to my pseudo-manager and she told me to try to put up with it and see if it gets better. I did, and they didn‚Äôt.\\n\\nI was feeling sick to my stomach with each drive hoping I would start that day knowing exactly what I was going to do. But that never happened. Instead I had a ton of things to get done under the supervision of my co-worker who would only let me work with her (again not a supervisor, just a co-worker). At this point I‚Äôm a month in and have no autonomy in my position. Any time I tried to get things done on my own I was called out for being away from my desk even though I was just trying to get work done (tasks at my job are done in a lab).\\n\\nIt was awful to experience this day by day. There were a lot of other issues as well but these were the ones that really riled up my anxiety. \\n\\nSo today I decided I had enough. I got to work early, cleaned up my desk, wrote a letter of resignation and just walked out the door without talking to anyone. \\n\\nWhen I left I had a panic attack on the long walk back to my car. My wife called me and tried to calm me down as I gasped for air crying in the parking lot. Eventually I gathered myself enough to make the drive home.\\n\\nI know it was my anxiety that told me to leave that way, but it just felt like the right decision given the amount of mental anguish the job caused me. I know I could have handled it better and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm beating my self up about this.\\n\\nMy anxiety is telling me to feel horrible and guilty for what I did. I know it was bad to do that to some of the hard working people there. Not everyone was bad, but the person I had to work closest with was a human nightmare. I hated being there so much that having to face everyone for two more weeks wasn‚Äôt worth it. I‚Äôm still scared they are going to retaliate against me in some way, and I‚Äôm dreading any kind of phone call or email coming from them.\\n\\nAt the moment I still feel bad about what I did since I don‚Äôt have anything lined up. However, I have a loving, supportive network of past co-workers and people who can vouch for me when it comes to the new job search. I‚Äôm anxious about what‚Äôs next but I‚Äôm already feeling better this toxic job is behind me. \\n\\nTLDR: I left a job I loved for a toxic nightmare job that killed my confidence and led me to just walk out. I feel bad about it but I also know it was the best decision for my mental health.',\n",
       "  'Edit: phishing, not fishing. \\nOkay, I figured here would be a good place to share the experience with like-minded individuals, and it\\'s a bit of a read, so here goes. \\n\\nI got a call from my mom\\'s phone number tonight. But when I picked up, it wasn\\'t my mom, but someone asking me, \"Sir, are you somewhere you can speak discreetly?\" And immediately my neurotic-ass brain goes to worst-case scenarios. They tell me that my mom is at the jail for failure to appear in court on December 12th (which happens to be my birthday, on which day she took me out to dinner). They said she would be released that day because her record is clean (which it is) but they would need me to sign that I would get court dates and remind her to be there. \\n\\nAnd the embarrassing thing is, this did seem fishy. I went to jail once, and I knew things didn\\'t totally add up - why would they call from her phone, and why wouldn\\'t she call her husband? I asked that, and they said she was embarrassed and wanted to call me instead to be discreet. It wasn\\'t even an embarrassing thing on her part, her husband would\\'ve understood. And she would\\'ve been able to pay her own bail. But I was already a nervous wreck from receiving the call and agreed to pay the 250 dollar charge. So shortly after that, they hung up, and I couldn\\'t get ahold of my mom, it went straight to voicemail. \\n\\nWell, I called her number and then she picked up about 30 minutes later, sounding totally relaxed. I asked if she was ok, and she said \"yeah, why? What\\'s wrong?\" And I knew it was a scam. So I explained to her, and said that the call ID literally said \"mom\" and that I knew things were weird but I was so worried and stressed that I folded despite knowing better. She told me to immediately call the number on my card and freeze it for fraud, and that when I go to the bank tomorrow everything would be covered under fraud protection. She said at least she knew I would be willing to help her, but that she would\\'ve been able to post her own bail, and that she would\\'ve called her husband first, or at least my brother (they live in the Waco Texas area, and I\\'m in Austin). \\n\\nI\\'m feeling a mess of feelings right now - it\\'s scary that they got her number, were able to emulate it, and had her contacts, and apparently called the kid that was such a neurotic mess that he would turn to mud instantly and pay up. I\\'m also embarrassed that, DESPITE KNOWING that there were so many red flags with the situation, I didn\\'t double check with my brother and I just bought into the \"didn\\'t want to tell her husband\" line. I\\'m not an idiot, but I feel like one for being such shit under stress. It\\'s rather fucking embarrassing. I know my bank will handle it, I\\'ll have to change my info on a few things and get a new card, and they preyed on the emotional side, but still, I knew so many things didn\\'t add up and yet I gave my info anyway. \\n\\nI appreciate anyone who reads this and shows support in advance. I also dont drink anymore, so despite needing a stiff drink REALLY badly, I\\'m gonna have to make due with having a smoke (which I dont really do anymore either) and watch some hockey to calm my nerves.

Over those years I‚Äôve tried countless coping strategies from running to reading to journaling to music and the list goes on. A couple things gave me mild relief from my anxiety, but when life really threw me a wrench and my anxiety was severe, I failed to find a strategy that gave me control. \\n\\nThat was all until I discovered kickboxing!

I also used to be an average runner, but my mind would still race while I ran. Kickboxing is 100% different. I try to go to classes 3-4 times a week and have been going for about 5 months. \\n\\nKickboxing is hard, but that‚Äôs what makes it so great for anxiety! You have to concentrate on your punches and your kicks and your hip movement and your balance and your core and your technique and your power. It‚Äôs so difficult, and you can‚Äôt be worrying about what else is going on in your life or you‚Äôll have a poor performance. For my 45 minute class, the rest of my life goes out the window and I get a great workout. Plus, all your tension leaves your body after throwing 1000 punches. \\n\\nI know anxiety looks different for everyone, and this is not for all, but if you‚Äôre like me and have tried a bunch of coping strategies with moderate success, I highly suggest giving kickboxing a try.

       "  \"I've struggled with anxiety for a long time, but the experience I just had was different (at least for me) than any other panic attack I've ever had. For all intents and purposes, I felt like I always do. Feeling of dread, crying, shaking, chest pain, shortness of breath, etc... All the tried and true symptoms there....minus one that usually terrifies me the most; my racing heart. Absolutely the number one thing that sparks an attack for me, that pounding in my chest, the seemingly uncontrollable, ever elevating heart rate. I constantly check my pulse during an attack, waiting for it to taper off (I know how bad that is, it's an obsessive thing for me) but this time, my heart rate never increased in the slightest. My resting heart rate is in the 50's, so to be experiencing a panic attack at my resting heart rate was even more terrifying, if that's even possible. Anyone else experience something like this? Not taking any meds or anything, nothing that would slow my heart rate. I don't know, but it scared me to death.\",\n",

With that being said, this year has been academically really easy for me. I like all of my teachers, there‚Äôs not a huge workload, and I am generally interested in the subjects. Sounds like everything is going great, right? NOPE! \\n\\nThe science class that I‚Äôm in has been causing me so much anxiety that when I come home, I have a hard time getting up to do anything. It‚Äôs like it just paralyzes me. One of our topics was serial killers, and I almost left the room every day because I couldn‚Äôt breathe. Or we would watch a video and there would be the sound of someone screaming and saying ‚Äústop‚Äù and I would start panicking, but I couldn‚Äôt get out of my seat. Then I would leave the class at the end of the day, feeling numb and super depressed. I‚Äôm in the second semester of this class, but I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can handle it. I don‚Äôt want to start self-harming again, and I don‚Äôt want to start having any suicidal thoughts. What should I do? Should I stay in this class because I only have a few more months left, I earn college credit for it, and I should just try to ‚Äútoughen up‚Äù? Or do I drop out because of the negative toll it is taking on my mental/emotional/social health? Or do you have any other suggestions for what I should do?\\n\\nThank you SO much to anyone who responds, I appreciate it. ',\n",

I\\'ve never had a full blown attack before, but the only times I\\'ve felt similarly were when I was suicidal in high school, when I got super high and had a horrible trip, and when I had my concussive memory loss a month ago. The only way I can explain it is that its an existential anxiety. I start thinking about existence and an immense fear of death washes over me. What happens when the lights go out? I feel like I disassociate with my humanity and stop seeing people as people.  Am I ever going to think normally again? I panic, I tremble, I sweat. I can\\'t get it out of my head, I can\\'t think of anything else. When I talked to my therapist, something odd struck me.  When I think about things that may increasingly stress people out (family, finances, career) start helping to bring me back down.  I start \"buying into my humanity\" again. When I come back down, I get a very minor headache. Not anything showstopping, but it wasn\\'t there before.\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\'m talking to a therapist, but I was kind of of looking to see if other people experience this. Am I mislabeling something or would find more shared experience within a different group?',\n",

Learning to deal with them with deep breathing , meditation and eating right I guess. No meds for me. I want to say  moving to a new city, new job, excitement and of course being anxious triggered these symptoms one morning. Never have I experienced an anxiety attack like that morning. HORRIBLE feeling. So since then. These symptoms  occur every now and then. They go away for sometime. I feel great. Then they're back and I'm in survival mode cause I'm in fear of dying. Sometimes. Don't understand them. I just want them to go away for good. I'd like to hear from everyone here what you think or know that triggered your anxiety. Either mentally or physically. \",\n",

I decided to take the day off of work and instead go to an immediate care facility first thing in the morning to have myself looked at. The doctor examined me and told me that I had a hernia. After she told me that I had a hernia, I started to feel a little light headed and queasy. I notified the doctor of this and she had me sit on the exam table so that I did not fall down or anything. 10 or so seconds later, I began to have a seizure. My eyes rolled back into my skull, I lost consciousness, and I began convulsing. About a minute after waking up, the paramedics arrived in the room. I foolishly refused to be taken to the hospital and I told the doctor I would just get a ride from my mother to the hospital to have my hernia looked at and to figure out why I had a seizure. My mother arrives and I get in her car to have her take me to the hospital. We get a few blocks down the street and I start feeling like I am going to pass out again. We turn around, go back to the doctor\\'s office and call 911 again. Paramedics end up taking me to the hospital. I have an ultrasound done in the ER and I am told that I DO NOT have a hernia. I also have an MRI done on my brain to see if any damage was done from the seizure and they say that there was no damage. I was told by an ER doctor that the reason I had a seizure and fainted was that I had a vasovagal syncope reaction to being told that I had a hernia. However, I am skeptical because people generally don\\'t have seizures with this type of thing. I was released from the ER the same day.\\n\\nI was discharged from the ER and was immediately ready to put this behind me. I wasn\\'t really concerned about it at all. However, my life as I know it completely changed from that day forward. To make a long story short, I immediately developed panic disorder/severe anxiety. Literally the same evening of the day that I was hospitalized and released, I started to notice that I was feeling strange. Within 2 weeks, things got really bad. I was up in the middle of the night having absolutely massive panic attacks for no reason whatsoever. Had my mother not given me some of her Xanax, I probably would have called an ambulance. The next morning my mother rushed me to a psychiatrist where I was prescribed Remeron and Xanax.\\n\\nI am trying to keep this story as short as possible, but things went downhill from here. I started having extremely severe cardiac symptoms. Horrible chest pain and pounding. I went to my PCP to figure out if there were any physical issues with me that would make me feel like this. He did a ton of blood work and discovered the presence of the Sjrogen\\'s antibody in my blood. My white blood cell count was also very low. He referred me to a Rheumatologist and a Cardiologist who did a ton of tests on me and told me I was fine. The Rheumatologist started treating me for Sjrogen\\'s based on my low white count and antibody presence. I had no physical symptoms except for somewhat dry eyes. He put me on Plaquenil which I was on for probably a year.\\n\\nBy the end of January 2018, my situation had gotten extremely severe. I had to go on a 4 hour, overnight road trip for work. I rode in the passenger seat on the way there and was convinced I was going to die the entire time. My coworker asked me to drive at one point and I literally could not. It was so bad that I literally contemplated jumping out of the moving car on the interstate. When I returned home from this trip, I immediately took a leave of absence from work. I was off work for all of February 2018 and some of March.\\n\\nI spent my time off of work desperately trying to get better. I have tried every drug under the sun since this has started out of thin air. I have tried: Xanax, Clonazepam, Remeron, Rexulti, Fetzima, Cymbalta, Buspar, Effexor, and I\\'m sure I am forgetting some. Effexor was successful with stopping panic attacks but I was having issues with sexual dysfunction and avolition.\\n\\nI could go on and on about strange symptoms and issues that I have been having since December 2017 but I will fast forward to present and the current issues I am having. I was switched to Trintellix about a month ago. It seems to have stopped most of the panic attacks and scary derealization symptoms I was having. However, my biggest problem now is depression, fatigue/sleepiness and lack of motivation to do anything. It seems like any periods of remission that I have had from panic attacks since this started have been filled with crippling depression and avolition. I have no motivation to do anything or things I used to love. This is especially true at work. I have absolutely zero drive at work and it is killing me. I spend like 12 hours a day in bed on weekends when I used to be up at 6 am doing things. On days when I have to work, I am virtually falling asleep at my desk for the first 3 hours of the day. I am also very lethargic at the gym.\\n\\nI know I have rambled a lot so I will sum up what my direct questions are.\\n\\nWhy did I have a seizure in the doctor\\'s office and why did I immediately develop panic disorder/anxiety after having the seizure?\\n\\nMy Rheumatologist has taken me off of Plaquenil now that my white blood cell count has normalized. I have stopped seeing him since he admittedly is not sure whether or not I have Sjrogen\\'s because I have few to no physical symptoms. So why was my white blood cell count so low at the time I had this seizure and why do I have the presence of the Sjrogen\\'s antibody in my blood? Could either of these things be linked to my panic attacks/anxiety?\\n\\nCould there be any physical issues with me in general that could be causing me to have issues with panic attacks/anxiety?\\n\\nWhy am I currently experiencing such extreme avolition?\\n\\nAny comments in general would be greatly appreciated.',\n",

I walk up there with my manager and the room is full of people. I realize the second I open the door that this is some kind of little party for me and my heart rate sky rockets. My coworker drags me inside, I‚Äôm definitely not breathing, people start clapping and apparently I said something like ‚Äúomg this is a nightmare‚Äù.

My hands are shaking, I feel like my chest is trying to implode, and I can barely hear what people are saying because I‚Äôm feeling faint. \\n\\nThey end up rushing through everything while I desperately try to calm down / stop crying. I try so hard to say thank you, and I can barely talk. My manager finally realizes I‚Äôm not just emotional, there‚Äôs something wrong, and they send everyone out.

For a long time I was in denial about having anxiety and I would just constantly tell myself that I was just in a rough patch of life and as soon as I reached the next stage and I had a fresh start life would be better. I started college this year and im finally coming to terms that this is a part of me and its not just gonna go away. Suddenly all of these things that I did throughout my life were because of my anxiety. I hated having to socialize with people sometimes even my closest friends and my parents would always wonder why I never had plans on the weekends and I would basically only ever make them to appease them and make them think I was \"normal\". I avoid people I know when I see them when im not expecting to just so I don\\'t have to interact.

When I get in trouble for something I feel so awful and sick to my stomach even if it\\'s really small. I constantly daydream about possible scenarios of my life either good or bad almost all the time. I always have to joke about the stupid or embarrassing things I do because I need to hide the intense embarrassment I feel over them and I will think about them even years later. I always assume that when someone cancels plans or doesn\\'t respond to a text its because I bother and annoy them. The only thing that really relieves my anxiety is watching tv shows and reading books because it allows me outside my own head and into a different space so I sometimes become obsessive about characters in books and shows.

But she didn't say anything, and she never has when I've had panic attacks around her before, she just carried on like normal.\\n\\nThis isn't because she's trying to spare my feelings or doesn't care, she just simply cannot tell when it's happening, and nobody I know can, despite how it feels to me like it must be SUPER obvious there's something up with me. \\n\\nI asked her later in the evening if she noticed anything, and she said I seemed a little quiet but I otherwise seemed completely normal.\\n\\nI've asked my mum about this before, and she swears up and down that no matter how distressing it is for someone having a panic attack, unless it's so severe that they pass out or something like that, and no matter how much it feels like you are sweating buckets and stumbling all over the place like a drunk, outwardly, you appear completely normal, and people simply cannot tell unless they're really examining you. You're just hyper vigilant in that mental state, and feel like everyone sees you as you are feeling - a sweaty, panicked mess.

       "  'Hey all, \\nEssentially I‚Äôve just had like a lifelong issue with social anxiety. A lot of it stems from a perceived concept of role on myself with relation to the people around me... \\nit‚Äôs kind of screwed with how I think about situations. \\nLike if I did something stupid two days ago, \\nI‚Äôm still going through it now. \\nToday I went on a date. And I‚Äôm honest to god unsure if it went really badly or really well. \\nIt takes over me. I can just imagine how uncomfortable I‚Äôm making people. \\nI‚Äôm wondering, do you have any tricks you have found to de escalate yourself from the kind of compulsive loop? To see how you interact with others more clearly? \\n\\nAny advice helps. And actually, maybe just writing it down does to. \\n',\n",
       "  \"ANXIETY!!!! \\nSo, I have some pretty extreme anxiety problems. Both alone and social. Frequently I wake up in the middle of the night and have chest tightening thoughts about anything and everything almost immediately. Old shit, present shit, future shit. \\n\\nI have no idea where this came from, but it is something that has helped me immensely that I have shared with a few folks, and it actually helped them too. \\nSo here is my version of late night anxiety control...\\n\\nI think of the alphabet. \\nI start at the beginning and name every animal I can think of per each letter. When my mind wanders back to the anxiety, I start again. \\nI have never made it through the whole ABC's without falling back to sleep. And I usually get a good sleep afterwards. So try it out if you want. Let me know. \",\n",
       "  \"I had to quit my job over not being able to do this. Does anybody have any tips? I used to be a great driver and I love cars and all, but now I can't make the drives I used to without my throat closing up.\",\n",
